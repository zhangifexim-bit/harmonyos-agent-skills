# DevEco CLI build decision tree

## 1. Can the selected Node start Hvigor?

Evidence:

- `Get-Command node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`
- `NODE_HOME` at Process/User/Machine scope
- `<DevEcoRoot>\tools\node\node.exe --version`
- project wrapper or `<DevEcoRoot>\tools\hvigor\bin\hvigorw.js`

If the shell has no usable Node and the active DevEco installation has a valid bundled Node, prefer that binary. Set only the current process:

```powershell
$env:NODE_HOME = '<DevEcoRoot>\tools\node'
$env:PATH = "$env:NODE_HOME;$env:PATH"
```

Retry the original command. Do not install Node immediately.

## 2. Does Hvigor reject SDK configuration?

Inspect `DEVECO_SDK_HOME` at all scopes, but change only Process scope. A directory's existence is insufficient: verify expected SDK families/toolchains and the API required by project configuration.

```powershell
$env:DEVECO_SDK_HOME = '<validated-sdk-root>'
```

Stop the existing daemon using the wrapper's local help, then retry. If the required component is absent, report `INVALID` or `NOT_FOUND`; do not modify the project or reinstall the SDK automatically.

## 3. Does packaging report `spawn java ENOENT`?

Evidence:

- `Get-Command java -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`
- `JAVA_HOME` at Process/User/Machine scope
- `<DevEcoRoot>\jbr\bin\java.exe -version`

If the bundled JBR is valid:

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = '<DevEcoRoot>\jbr'
$env:PATH = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"
```

Stop the daemon and retry the original task. Do not reinstall a JDK first.

## 4. Did the failure move into project configuration or compilation?

Once Node, SDK, and Java evidence is valid, classify the new causal error independently:

- product/build mode/module mismatch;
- missing SDK component for the configured API;
- dependency resolution;
- ArkTS compile error;
- signing configuration;
- packaging or artifact verification.

An environment repair is successful only when it removes the environment error. It does not prove the application is correct.
